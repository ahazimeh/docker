image vs containers:
image is the template blueprint for containers that contains code, required tools and runtime
container is the running unit of software

to pull and run docker image
docker run node
docker run -it node (it to expose an interactive session from inside the container to our hosting machine)
sudo docker start containerName// to start an existing container
