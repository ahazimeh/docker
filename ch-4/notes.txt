localhost should be replaced by host.docker.internal
but it didn't work for linux
for linux I only added --network=host when running the container

docker run --name mongodb mongo
docker container inspect mongodb
    copy the ip address
    'mongodb://ip address:27017/swfavorites'

another soln:
docker network create favorites-net
    docker network ls
docker run --rm -d --name mongodb --network favorites-net -d mongo
docker run --name favorite --rm -p 3000:3000 --network favorites-net favorites-node
'mongodb://mongodb:27017/swfavorites'

note for mongodb container we didn't provide the -p option because it is required only if
we plan on connecting to something in to that container from our local host machine
or from outside the container network, in this case we won't do that
